* buffer pool
The buffer pool is an area in main memory where InnoDB caches table and index data as data is accessed. The buffer pool allows frequently used data to be processed directly from memory, which speeds up processing. On dedicated database servers, up to 80% of physical memory is often assigned to the InnoDB buffer pool.
For efficiency of high-volume read operations, the buffer pool is divided into pages that can potentially hold multiple rows. For efficiency of cache management, the buffer pool is implemented as a linked list of pages; data that is rarely used is aged out of the cache, using a variation of the LRU algorithm.

* force recovery
To investigate database page corruption, you might dump your tables from the database with SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE. Usually, most of the data obtained in this way is intact. Serious corruption might cause SELECT * FROM tbl_name statements or InnoDB background operations to crash or assert, or even cause InnoDB roll-forward recovery to crash. In such cases, you can use the innodb_force_recovery option to force the InnoDB storage engine to start up while preventing background operations from running, so that you can dump your tables. 
Only set innodb_force_recovery to a value greater than 0 in an emergency situation, so that you can start InnoDB and dump your tables. Before doing so, ensure that you have a backup copy of your database in case you need to recreate it. Values of 4 or greater can permanently corrupt data files. Only use an innodb_force_recovery setting of 4 or greater on a production server instance after you have successfully tested the setting on a separate physical copy of your database. When forcing InnoDB recovery, you should always start with innodb_force_recovery=1 and only increase the value incrementally, as necessary.

* ibuf_bitmap
The INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INNODB_BUFFER_PAGE table provides metadata about each page in the buffer pool, including change buffer index and change buffer bitmap pages. Change buffer pages are identified by PAGE_TYPE. IBUF_INDEX is the page type for change buffer index pages, and IBUF_BITMAP is the page type for change buffer bitmap pages.
